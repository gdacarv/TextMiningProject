Abstract. Business Process Management can lead to better organizational
and flexible performance. But when new processes are designed or existing
processes shall be improved, it is always hard to predict the resulting
performance. The integration of simulation methods with BPM tools is a
promising approach which provides a better understanding of processes
execution behavior. However, the accuracy and precision of the results must
be  evaluated  in  a  formal  way,  as  a  need  to  obtain  more  confident
simulations.  This  paper  proposes  an  approach  to  evaluate  the  results
obtained from simulation of business processes. A formal case study was
conducted  to  evaluate  the  application  of  the  approach.  At  the  end,  a
discussion is presented about the results of the evaluation.
1. Introduction
Simulation is not a new subject in computer science. Especially in the field of logistics
or production planning it has played an important role for some years  [Page and
Kreutzer,                                                                                   2005].  Because  it  is  quite  expensive  to  correct  planning  errors  after
constructing a product or a service, a good modeling is a crucial success factor.
In the last years, Business Process Management  (BPM) became very popular
when Hammer and Champy introduced the Business Process Reengineering [Hammer
and Champy, 2003]. When simulation of business processes emerged, they included a
high effort for capturing statistical data from their running business to enable valuable
simulations.
The simulation can answer questions concerning the resulting behavior, compare
processes  versions  or  show  impact  within  the  organization  structure.  A  common
approach is to integrate a simulation tool with the BPM environment, so it can share the
same model with the process engine. This safes effort when modeling a business
process and enables accessing historical data of the engine for later optimizations.
The  summarized  main  motivation  behind  this  paper  is  to  provide  a  formal
validation of the results when applying the approach which integrates simulation and
BPM. We extended the model proposed by [TIBCO, 2009] with the presentation of a
case study, where the average execution times of several simulation scenarios were
evaluated throughout descriptive statistic. At the end, some conclusions concerning the
output results from the integration of a simulation environment and a BPM tool are
presented.
The remainder of this paper is presented as follows. In Section 2, the related work
is presented. Thereafter, in Section  3, we provide a detailed explanation about the
evaluation  methodology  adopted.  This  section  describes  the  integration  approach
adopted,  the  experiment  definition  and  its  execution.  Next,  Section                 4  presents  a




discussion of alternatives scenarios for our case study. Finally, in Section 5 we conclude
with final remarks.
2. Related Work
This section describes the state of the art for business process simulation and the
ongoing research projects.
Many authors have proposed requirements for business process simulation tools
([Davenport, 1993], [Paul et al., 1999], [Spurr et al., 1993], [de Vreede et al., 2003]) or
have tested these requirements empirically [Hlupic and Robinson, 1998], [Kettinger et
al.,                                                                                           1997]. Law and Kelton describe desirable software features for the selection of
general purpose simulation software [Law and Kelton, 2000]. They identify a group of
features to describe the general capabilities of such tools, including modeling flexibility,
hardware  and  software  considerations,  statistical  capabilities  and  output  reports
customization.
The most famous goal in literature is to simulate new designed or improved
processes  [Bosilj-Vuksic et al.,  2007][ Jansen-Vullers et al.,  2006], for example in
Business  Processes  Reengineering  or  so  called  Business  Process  Change                  (BPC)
projects. This is followed by capacity or staff planning, where a typical goal is to find a
good tradeoff between costs for resources and waiting times [Harmon, 2003]. Taking
into account that only a small percentage of the BPM clients uses simulation [Laguna
and Marlund, 2004], it is clear that the focus is on goals, which are easy to achieve. In a
summarized  review  of  these  relevant  papers,  it  is  clear  that  if  the  simulation
environment is capable of using historical data as input for simulation, easy achievable
goals  are  basically  capacity  planning  and  benchmarks  of  different  parameter
configurations. Moreover, frequency or probabilities must be expressed by simple or
very sophisticated statistical distributions. The same goes for processing or transport
times. They can be defined statistically by some average or by a much more realistic
distribution.
3. Evaluation Strategy
As stated previously, the main objective of this paper is to evaluate the results obtained
from the integration of a simulation environment with a business process execution
context. Since we are concerned with the quality of the simulation and assuming we
want to be as close as possible within the actual data, a case study was performed in
order to evaluate the statistical degree of approximation of the results obtained from the
simulation. These results were compared with a representative sample of the execution
of  actual  business  process.  The  strategy  adopted  for  this  experiment  was  the
parametrical hypothesis testing for a pair of means. For this subject, it was gathered the
output data from two known open source/freeware tools, which integrates simulation
and BPM within a single environment: JBoss jBPM [Cumberlidge, 2007] and TIBCO
[TIBCO, 2009]. With the first tool we collected the sample from the actual business
process. The second tool provided the simulation environment which the remainder of
this experiment were performed. The definition of the experiment was made in terms of
its goals, questions and metrics as defined in [Basili et al., 1994].




3.1. Goal-Questions-Metrics
G1. To analyze the approach for the purpose of validating it with respect to the
statistical degree of approximation from the point of view of business analysts in the
context of business process management.
Q1. How close are the means obtained from the business processes simulation and its
actual execution, given accurate input parameter values?
M1. Average Time of Execution. We want to measure and evaluate the means of the
processes execution times. According to  [DeGroot,  1989], we shall assume that all
observation for both actual and simulated observations have a normal distribution.
Next, we define the significance level, here denoted by  , which is the probability that
an estimated range does not contain a particular population parameter. Finally, we shall
apply a hypothesis test for unpaired data, which will be supported by a Student’s t
statistical distribution. For this subject, we applied the Two-Sample t Test [DeGroot,
1989] as a way to discover the statistical degree of approximation for those means. To
                                                                                               be more formal, let                                                                                               x                                   and       x                                                                                                                                                   be the sample means of the actual and simulated

3.2. Null Hypothesis
In this study, the null hypothesis express that there is no significant difference between
the means of the statistical distribution for a set of simulated and real scenarios. The
analysis performed with a given confidence level indicates if the business process
simulation approach is worthwhile. For this experiment we adopted 3 confidence levels
(1-α) in order to test the null hypothesis: 90%, 95% and 99%. This approach uses a
symmetric  two-sided  t  Test  based  on  the  given  statistic                                                                                                                                                                                                    [DeGroot,   1989].  Thus,
                                                                                                                     according to the criteria defined previously, the null hypothesis for this experiment is:
H                                                                                              :                                                                                                                                                           0

3.3. Alternative Hypothesis
This is the hypothesis in favor of which the null hypothesis is rejected. In this study, the
alternative hypothesis reflects that there is a significant difference between the average
times of execution. The alternative hypothesis is:

3.4. Project Description
The study has configured as project whose main objective was to execute the tasks of a
business process related with the domain of a DVD movies store based on the internet.
As a basis for the business process execution, a framework previously built in Java
platform was available to derive the scenarios. The application allows the internet users
to search and buy DVDs after a register and login operations. When a user completes its
order, the application starts a business process execution to approve and to ship the
items bought. A manager receives the list of pending orders and assigns them to a
shipment process. Finally, the manager ships the items to costumers. In parallel, the
costumer can keep track of whole shipment process through its “My Orders” page. The
shipping process was modeled in jPDL notation [JBoss, 2008], built upon a set of Java
platform technologies, including JBoss Seam Framework, EJB3 and jBPM.
3.5. Business Process Simulation
The simulation activities can be decomposed in a few steps, according to  [TIBCO,
2009]. We modified the approach presented in that work by incorporating a task to
retrieve historical data. The Figure 1 presents a diagram that summarizes the activities
for simulation. All these steps were performed during the experiment operation and its
evaluation.

3.6. Quantitative Analysis
The analysis compared a shipment process scenario in terms of its execution metrics.
First, we performed an experiment that aims to create a historical database for the
project execution. In this step, the business process for shipping products was modeled
“as-is”, using the jPDL notation [JBoss, 2008]. In order to establish a single Service
Level Agreement (SLA) for the shipping process, we stated that 2 minutes to assign an
order to shipment approval and the shipment task itself will be sufficient to keep a high
level  of satisfaction for  the store costumers.  All  data generated from  the process




execution was stored in a set of XML files, so they could be easily retrieved from a
single parser application.
At  this  moment,  two  experiment  roles  were  defined:  Customer  and  Manager.
Customers were responsible for browsing a movie catalog, choosing one or more
movies, adding them to a shopping cart and confirming the payment. The role Manager
played the function for browsing the list of orders, assign one order at time for the
shipment approval and fire the shipment event. For this experiment, five subjects played
the Customer’s role and one subject was responsible to play the Manager’s role. The
Manager also had as a main objective to ship each order within 2 minutes period. Table
1 summarizes the project numbers.

In the first group of data we found the average for the payment and order posting
times. It was not taken into account the time necessary to browse the movies catalog,
since it was not considered part of the shipment process. The data collected presented a
value of 0,085277778 order posted per second. The subjects that played costumer role
posted orders for a sample period of 60 minutes. The second group of data includes the
whole  shipment  process  statistics.  Here,  it  was  considered  the  time  between  the
payment confirmation and the shipment approval for a single order. In the  “as-is”
scenario we obtained the value of 12,077723 minutes for the average shipping process
time.  The  standard  deviation  was                                                         12,123277  minutes,  which  means  that  process
execution speed had a high level of variation. Table 2 summarizes the values found on
“as-is” execution.

3.6.1. Degree of Approximation Analysis
For the event that simulated the orders payment process  (which is not part of the
shipping process), we assigned an exponential distribution with a mean of 0,085277778
payments per second. This strategy was responsible to simulate a sequence of temporal
events coming up into the web application. For the shipping process we adopted a
normal  distribution  with  mean  of                                                       2  minutes  and  standard  deviation  of  1  minute,
according to our SLA target. The number of cases simulated was 307, the same as the
“as-is” process, and the same jPDL process model was imported into the simulation
tool. The statistic gathered from the simulation execution was summarized in Table 3.

Conclusion 1. Despite the values obtained from simulation indicates that there is no
significant differences for the average execution time, with 5% and 10% of significance
level, we can state that this approach is not totally accurate when we apply a more
rigorous significance level (1% in our case study). In general, after execution of the
experiment for all cases, we can state that the approach indicates precisely that a
simulation can be adopted when evaluating business processes. This result can be
interpreted  as  a  consequence  of  using  accurate  input  values  in  the  simulation
environment, which produces precise output values.
4. Alternative Scenarios
As presented in Section  3.5, after running the simulation we can make two single
decisions: optimize the  “as-is” process or create a  “to-be” process. We decided to




change the process in order to achieve the two minutes SLA for shipping an order. Note
that this value must be considered for all shipment cases, with no standard deviation
considered here.
Assuming that our approach can be precise, but not accurate in general, we
decided  to  investigate  alternatives  scenarios  and  find  out  an  optimal  number  of
managers that satisfies the SLA. To accomplish this, we changed the input data of
shipping process simulation to compare the average case time with the SLA value. After
5 rounds of simulation we found the number of 6 managers to ship all orders within the
period of 2 minutes. We are not considering a standard deviation here, since all cases
must be attended in a time period less or equal to 2 minutes. Table 5 shows the values
obtained from all simulation rounds.

The number in bold for 3 managers highlights the estimated maximum shipping
time that satisfies all orders. Although a scenario with 3 managers has an average time
of 1.872 minutes, the largest time to ship an order is 4.598 minutes, which are out of
SLA target.
Conclusion                                                                                    2.  Our  feeling  about  the  ideal  number  of  managers  lies  on   6,  since
proportion of 12:2 minutes could be analyzed in a linear way. However, without a tool
to produce several alternatives scenarios, the business case for shipping orders cannot
be established with a certain level of confidence. As a consequence, the simulation can
be  used  for  decision  making  purposes,  helping  the  organization  in  its  processes
optimization.
5. Conclusion and Final Remarks
This paper described a case study where the evaluation of the results obtained
from  simulation  of business processes  was  performed. We extended the approach
defined by [TIBCO, 2009] in order to include the capture of historical data from an
order shipment business processes. This fact proved that historical data can provide a
solid basis to start a simulation activity. The information gathered from the “as-is”
process execution indicated that simulation could be more precise when accurate input
data is given.
The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of an evaluation approach
for  the  results  of  the  integration  between  BPM  and  simulation,  using  descriptive
statistics and a Two-Sample t Test. Although accuracy cannot be detected within a
rigorous margin of error, the whole approach proved to be useful to decision making,
since it can indicate alternatives scenarios to optimize the set of process of a company.
As a lesson learned, we can highlight the need for calibration of event distribution,
which can lead to the occurrence of some noise in the chain of simulation.




As a future work to improve the quality of output data and the level of confidence
in the whole simulation approach, we can highlight the extension of our approach to
include the evaluation of the relevance of data retrieved from execution logs. Another
point for improvement is the risk assessment to implement the alternatives scenarios.
Finally the approach could provide more performance indicators, since there is a large
number of attributes that can be taken into account during the simulation.
